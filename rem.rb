#Welcome to rem.rb

#rem stands for "remove and remember"
#use to parse through a string
#make matches (rems) of any regexp-like object, and store the matches within the the string instance for later retreival/manipulation
#also stored within the instance is a substring of self after removal of all matches up to that point

#TERMS:
#rem: a string that has been or will be retreived from 'remsult' and stored into the rems array.  say: "I retreive a rem of a regexp from the remsult of the self string" 
#or "I add a rem of a regexp to the rems array of the self string"
#remsult: the working substring from which rems are retrived; initializes to self
#remd: the last rem that has been retreived

    #Strings within the scope of the Remmable module should be themselves remmable
    #especially important if self was made Remmable by using the Remmable::RemString module
    #without this, you could not call Remmable mothods on self within this module...
